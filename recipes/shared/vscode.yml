# This is a hack to allow for install of VSCode while still checking the 
# GPG signatures on the packages.  Apparently both Microsoft is using
# outdated crypto to sign packages, and their algorithms are no longer allowed by
# default in EL 10.  So we allow it *temporarily* so we can get the package installed.
# It's giving up some security, but it's better than not checking the signatures at all.
#
# Note that should be done as the last DNF module instance, just to make sure that the
# other RPMs are validated with the best crypto (and also EPEL doesn't work with legacy
# algorithms).
